	<h3><u>Roots Of Quadratic Equation:-</u></h3>
	<p><strong>Quadratics</strong> or <strong>Quadratic Equations</strong> can be defined as a polynomial equation of a second degree, which implies that it comprises of a minimum of one term that is squared. The general form of the quadratic equation is: 
		ax² + bx + c = 0
		where x is an unknown variable and a,b,c are numerical coefficients 
		Here, a ≠ 0 because if it equals zero then the equation will not remain quadratic anymore and it will become a linear equation, such as: 
		bx+c=0
		Thus, this equation cannot be called a quadratic equation.
		The terms a, b and c are also called quadratic coefficients. </p>

	<h3><u>Quadratics Formula:-</u></h3>
	<p>The formula for a quadratic equation is used to find the roots of the equation. Since quadratics have a degree equal to two, therefore there will be two solutions for the equation. Suppose, ax² + bx + c = 0 is the quadratic equation, then the formula to find the roots of this equation will be:
		x = [-b±√(b2-4ac)]/2
		The sign of plus/minus indicates there will be two solutions for x. Learn in detail the quadratic formula here.</p>
